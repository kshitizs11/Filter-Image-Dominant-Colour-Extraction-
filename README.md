# Filter-Image-Dominant-Colour-Extraction-
The K-means clustering algorithm defines a number K of clusters and the best “centroids” to cluster the data around. When applied to images, it allows extracting the k dominant colors in an image to be used for other purposes.
# How it works?
#### Basically, k-means is a clustering algorithm used in Machine Learning where a set of data points are to be categorized to ‘k’ groups. It works on simple distance calculation.
#### 1) At random select ‘k’ points not necessarily from the dataset.
#### 2) Assign each data point to closest cluster.
#### 3) Compute and place the new centroid of each cluster.
#### 4) Reassign the data points to the new closest cluster. If any reassignment took place go to step 3 else the model is ready.
